My portfolio for the year 2024, afterwards it's in dark mode and with a bit of glassmorphism.
It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). The design is inspired by the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) documentation and the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) website. The website is hosted on Vercel and the source code is available on GitHub.
