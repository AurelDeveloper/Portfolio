**Note**: The frontend is in `letter-display` repository.

## Explication

It's a backend script for a website template that automatically displays the newsletter articles on a Next.js frontend website. (The frontend is not included in this repository and is not yet developed)

1. Run the `src/main.py`.
2. The `src/main.py` will execute `src/utils/fetcher.py`, which checks if there is a new email from the newsletter sender. If yes, it checks the subject for a filter word; if no, it fetches the email content.
3. The `src/main.py` will execute `src/utils/extractor.py`, which extracts the main title, main image, a snippet from the article text, and calculates the reading time.
4. The `src/main.py` will execute `src/utils/uploader.py`, which uploads all the data to the Supabase table.
